MCP Filesystem Tools (via mcp_toolset)**\n- Provides 8 filesystem operations: read_file, write_file, create_directory, list_directory, etc.\n- Enables agent to directly interact with the FAQ knowledge base stored at `/tmp/faq-knowledge/faqs`\n- Allows dynamic reading of FAQ files without hardcoding data\n- Critical for maintaining separation of concerns between code and data\n\n**2. Custom Function Tools (6 tools total)**\n\n**Search & Discovery:**\n- `search_faqs()`: Semantic search across FAQ database using keyword matching and relevance scoring\n- `get_faq_categories()`: Lists all available FAQ categories with descriptions and counts\n\n**Analytics & Learning:**\n- `track_question()`: Records user queries with timestamps and categories for usage analytics\n- Enables the agent to learn which topics users ask about most frequently\n\n**User Context Management:**\n- `save_user_preference()`: Stores user-specific context (location, language, accessibility needs)\n- `get_user_preference()`: Retrieves saved preferences to personalize future interactions\n- Creates continuity across sessions by remembering user needs\n\n#### Why This Architecture?\n\n**Separation of Concerns:**\n- MCP tools handle data access layer (filesystem operations)\n- Custom tools handle business logic (search algorithms, analytics, preferences)\n- System instructions handle personality and behavior\n- Each layer can be modified independently without affecting others\n\n**Scalability:**\n- New FAQ categories can be added by simply creating new JSON files\n- New tools can be added to the tools array without rewriting existing code\n- Tool docstrings guide the LLM on when/how to use each tool\n\n**Maintainability:**\n- No hardcoded FAQ data in code or instructions\n- Tool functionality is self-contained and testable\n- Clear separation makes debugging easier\n\n**ADK Concepts Demonstrated:**\n1. **Custom Function Tools**: All 6 custom tools show how to extend agent capabilities\n2. **MCP Integration**: Filesystem tools demonstrate MCP server integration\n3. **Multi-Tool Architecture**: Agent intelligently selects from 14+ total tools\n4. **Session State**: Preference tools enable stateful interactions across sessions\n\nThis configuration enables the agent to handle complex scenarios like multi-problem queries, emergency situations, and personalized recommendations while maintaining clean architectural principles.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create enhanced agent with ALL tools\nfaq_agent_enhanced = LlmAgent(\n    model=model,\n    name=\"faq_assistant_enhanced\",\n    instruction=enhanced_instruction,\n    tools=[\n        mcp_toolset,                           # MCP filesystem access\n        FunctionTool(search_faqs),             # Smart search\n        FunctionTool(get_faq_categories),      # Category listing\n        FunctionTool(track_question),          # Question tracking\n        FunctionTool(save_user_preference),    # Save context\n        FunctionTool(get_user_preference)      # Retrieve context\n    ]\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ Enhanced FAQ agent created with 6 tools\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-27T17:31:28.971290Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-27T17:31:28.971570Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-27T17:31:29.006064Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-27T17:31:28.971550Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-27T17:31:29.004909Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ Enhanced FAQ agent created with 6 tools\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":19},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Session Service and Runner Initialization\n\nConfigures the execution environment for the agent by establishing session management and creating the runner that orchestrates agent interactions.\n\n#### Component Breakdown\n\n**1. InMemorySessionService()**\n\nThe session service manages conversation state and continuity across agent interactions.\n\n**What It Does:**\n- Stores conversation history in memory for the duration of the application\n- Maintains separate sessions for different users/conversations\n- Tracks the full dialogue context including user messages, agent responses, and tool calls\n- Enables the agent to reference previous interactions within the same session\n\n**Why In-Memory:**\n- Lightweight solution suitable for notebook environments\n- No external database dependencies\n- Fast access to session data\n- Acceptable for development, testing, and single-user scenarios\n- Data persists only while the notebook kernel is running\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Sessions are lost when kernel restarts\n- Not suitable for production multi-user applications\n- Cannot persist data across application restarts\n- For production, use persistent session services (database-backed)\n\n**2. Runner Configuration**\n\nThe Runner is the execution engine that manages agent lifecycle and coordinates between components.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- **agent**: The `faq_agent_enhanced` instance with all tools and instructions\n- **app_name**: `\"faq_assistant\"` - Application identifier used for logging and session naming\n- **session_service**: The InMemorySessionService instance for state management\n\n**Runner Responsibilities:**\n- **Orchestration**: Manages the request-response cycle between user and agent\n- **Session Management**: Links each interaction to the appropriate session via session_service\n- **Tool Execution**: Coordinates tool calls when the agent requests them\n- **Error Handling**: Manages API errors, retries, and failure scenarios\n- **Context Preservation**: Ensures conversation history flows correctly through multi-turn dialogues\n\n#### How They Work Together\n```\nUser Query → Runner → Agent (with context from session_service)\n                ↓\n         Agent selects tool\n                ↓\n         Runner executes tool\n                ↓\n         Tool result → Agent\n                ↓\n         Agent generates response → Runner → User\n                ↓\n         Full interaction saved to session_service\n```\n\n#### Session Management Flow\n\n**First Interaction:**\n1. User sends query to runner\n2. Runner creates new session in session_service (or retrieves existing)\n3. Agent receives query with empty history\n4. Agent processes and responds\n5. Runner saves full interaction (query + response + tool calls) to session\n\n**Subsequent Interactions:**\n1. User sends follow-up query\n2. Runner retrieves session history\n3. Agent receives query WITH full conversation context\n4. Agent can reference previous interactions\n5. Runner appends new interaction to session\n\n#### Why This Matters for the FAQ Agent\n\n**Enables Personalization:**\n- Preference tools (save/get_user_preference) work because session persists\n- Agent remembers user's location, language, accessibility needs\n- Follow-up questions don't require repeating context\n\n**Supports Complex Dialogues:**\n- User: \"I need mental health resources\"\n- Agent: [provides resources] \"What's your zip code for local options?\"\n- User: \"90210\" ← Agent still knows this is about mental health\n- Agent: [provides location-specific mental health resources]\n\n**Analytics Continuity:**\n- track_question() can reference session_id for user journey analysis\n- Can identify patterns in how users navigate the FAQ system\n\n#### ADK Concept Demonstrated\n\n**Session State Management**: This configuration demonstrates ADK's session handling capability, one of the four required concepts for the capstone project. The session service ensures the agent maintains context across multiple turns of conversation, enabling stateful interactions.\n\n#### Production Considerations\n\nFor production deployment, replace InMemorySessionService with:\n- **Database-backed session service** for persistence\n- **Redis-backed session service** for distributed systems\n- **Cloud session services** (Firestore, DynamoDB) for scalability\n\nExample structure for production:\n```python\n# Production example (not implemented here)\nfrom google.adk.sessions import FirestoreSessionService\n\nsession_service = FirestoreSessionService(\n    project_id=\"your-project\",\n    collection_name=\"faq_sessions\"\n)\n```\n\nThe Runner remains unchanged - ADK's architecture allows swapping session services without modifying agent code.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create session service and runner\nsession_service = InMemorySessionService()\n\nrunner = Runner(\n    agent=faq_agent_enhanced,\n    app_name=\"faq_assistant\",\n    session_service=session_service\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ Runner created with session management\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-27T17:31:29.007205Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-27T17:31:29.007563Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-27T17:31:29.031692Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-27T17:31:29.007539Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-27T17:31:29.030710Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ Runner created with session management\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":20},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Conversation Runner Function\n\nAsynchronous helper function that manages multi-turn conversations with the agent, handling rate limiting, streaming responses, and session continuity.\n\n#### Function Signature\n\n```python\nasync def run_conversation(\n    runner_instance: Runner,\n    queries: list,\n    session_id: str\n)\n```\n\n**Parameters:**\n- **runner_instance**: The Runner object that orchestrates agent execution\n- **queries**: List of query strings to process sequentially in one conversation\n- **session_id**: Unique identifier for this conversation session (enables context persistence)\n\n#### Implementation Details\n\n**1. Sequential Query Processing**\n\n```python\nfor i, query_text in enumerate(queries):\n```\n\nIterates through queries in order, processing each one completely before moving to the next. This ensures:\n- Each query has full context from previous queries\n- Session state builds naturally across the conversation\n- Analytics tracking captures the complete user journey\n\n**2. Rate Limit Compliance**\n\n```python\nif i > 0:\n    print(\"⏱️  Waiting 60 seconds (rate limit compliance)...\")\n    await asyncio.sleep(60)\n```\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n- Google's free-tier API limit: **10 requests per minute**\n- Each agent query can trigger **multiple API calls** (tool use + response generation)\n- A single query might use 2-4 API calls (search tool → get preferences → generate response)\n- 60-second wait ensures we stay well under the limit\n\n**Rate Limit Math:**\n- Single query = 2-4 API calls\n- 10 queries/minute ÷ 3 avg calls = ~3 queries/minute safe\n- 60-second wait = 1 query/minute = **ultra-safe for free tier**\n\n\n**3. Query Construction**\n\n```python\nquery = types.Content(role=\"user\", parts=[types.Part(text=query_text)])\n```\n\nCreates a properly formatted message object following Gemini API structure:\n- **Content**: Container for the message\n- **role=\"user\"**: Identifies this as user input (vs. \"model\" for agent responses)\n- **parts**: Array of message components (here, just text)\n- **Part(text=...)**: The actual query text wrapped in a Part object\n\nThis structure allows for multi-modal messages (text + images) in future enhancements.\n\n**4. Async Streaming Execution**\n\n```python\nasync for event in runner_instance.run_async(\n    user_id=\"test_user\",\n    session_id=session_id,\n    new_message=query\n):\n```\n\n**run_async() Parameters:**\n- **user_id**: Identifier for the user making the request (used for analytics/logging)\n- **session_id**: Links this query to the ongoing conversation session\n- **new_message**: The formatted query to process\n\n**Why Async Streaming:**\n- **Responsiveness**: Outputs text as it's generated, not all at once\n- **Better UX**: User sees progress rather than waiting for complete response\n- **Resource Efficient**: Doesn't block while waiting for LLM generation\n- **Event-Driven**: Receives events as they occur (tool calls, partial responses, final answer)\n\n**Event Stream Structure:**\nThe async generator yields events representing:\n- Tool selection by the agent\n- Tool execution results\n- Partial text generation (streaming response)\n- Final complete response\n\n**5. Response Processing**\n\n```python\nif event.content and event.content.parts:\n    for part in event.content.parts:\n        if part.text and part.text != \"None\":\n            print(f\"Agent: {part.text}\")\n```\n\n**Event Filtering:**\n- **event.content**: Check if event contains content (some events are just metadata)\n- **event.content.parts**: Verify parts array exists\n- **part.text**: Extract text content\n- **!= \"None\"**: Filter out placeholder/empty responses\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n- Not all events contain text output (e.g., tool call events)\n- Some intermediate events may have \"None\" as placeholder\n- This ensures we only display actual agent responses to user\n\n#### Usage Pattern\n\n```python\n# Example: Multi-turn conversation\nqueries = [\n    \"I need help with diabetes management\",\n    \"What about nutrition resources?\",\n    \"Do you have Spanish language options?\"\n]\n\nawait run_conversation(\n    runner_instance=runner,\n    queries=queries,\n    session_id=\"session_001\"\n)\n```\n\n**What Happens:**\n1. Query 1: Agent searches FAQs, may save location preference, responds about diabetes\n2. **60-second wait** (rate limit)\n3. Query 2: Agent remembers diabetes context, searches nutrition resources\n4. **60-second wait**\n5. Query 3: Agent checks preferences, provides Spanish resources, saves language preference\n\n#### Session Continuity Demonstration\n\n**Without session_id (new session each time):**\n```\nUser: \"I need mental health help\"\nAgent: [provides general resources]\nUser: \"What about for teens?\"  \nAgent: \"What topic are you asking about?\" ← No context\n```\n\n**With session_id (persistent session):**\n```\nUser: \"I need mental health help\"\nAgent: [provides general resources]\nUser: \"What about for teens?\"\nAgent: \"For teen mental health...\" ← Remembers context\n```\n\n#### Error Handling Considerations\n\n**Current Implementation:**\n- No explicit error handling (relies on model wrapper's retry logic)\n- Errors will propagate to caller\n\n**Production Enhancement:**\n```python\ntry:\n    async for event in runner_instance.run_async(...):\n        # process event\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"❌ Error processing query: {e}\")\n    # Log error, retry, or gracefully degrade\n```\n\n#### ADK Concepts Demonstrated\n\n**1. Session State Management:**\n- session_id parameter maintains conversation context\n- Enables multi-turn dialogues with memory\n\n**2. Async Execution:**\n- Demonstrates ADK's async API for efficient I/O handling\n- Streaming responses for better user experience\n\n**3. Runner Orchestration:**\n- Shows how Runner coordinates agent, tools, and session service\n- Proper message formatting for ADK framework\n\n#### Performance Characteristics\n\n**Timing per Query (typical):**\n- Rate limit wait: 60 seconds (between queries)\n- API processing: 2-5 seconds\n- Tool execution: 1-2 seconds\n- Total: ~63-67 seconds per query after first\n\n**API Call Budget:**\n- 400-500 total calls available (free tier daily limit)\n- 3 calls per query average = ~133-166 queries per day\n- With 60-second spacing = conservative free-tier usage\n\nThis conservative approach ensures reliable operation within Google's free-tier constraints while demonstrating proper async patterns and session management for the capstone project.\n```","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"async def run_conversation(\n    runner_instance: Runner,\n    queries: list,\n    session_id: str\n):\n    \"\"\"Process multiple queries in one session, sequentially with rate limiting.\"\"\"\n    import asyncio\n    \n    for i, query_text in enumerate(queries):\n        if i > 0:\n            print(\"\\n\" + \"-\"*60)\n            # Rate limiting: Wait 7 seconds between requests to stay under 10/min limit\n            print(\"⏱️  Waiting 60 seconds (rate limit compliance)...\")\n            await asyncio.sleep(60)\n        \n        print(f\"Query {i+1}: {query_text}\\n\")\n        \n        query = types.Content(role=\"user\", parts=[types.Part(text=query_text)])\n        \n        async for event in runner_instance.run_async(\n            user_id=\"test_user\",\n            session_id=session_id,\n            new_message=query\n        ):\n            if event.content and event.content.parts:\n                for part in event.content.parts:\n                    if part.text and part.text != \"None\":\n                        print(f\"Agent: {part.text}\")\n\nprint(\"✅ Helper function defined\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-27T17:31:29.032907Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-27T17:31:29.033256Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-27T17:31:29.061452Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-27T17:31:29.033233Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-27T17:31:29.059975Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ Helper function defined\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":21},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## Test the Agent\n\nLet's test our FAQ agent with various questions to ensure it can access and use the knowledge base.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Test 1: Smart FAQ Search\n\nValidates core search functionality - agent finds relevant FAQs and synthesizes answers.\n\n#### What It Tests\n\n- Agent selects `search_faqs` tool autonomously\n- Extracts relevant keywords from vague query (\"information about insurance\")\n- Returns multiple relevant FAQs\n- Formats response coherently\n\n#### Query\n```python\n\"Search for information about insurance\"\n```\n\n**Intentionally vague** - tests semantic understanding, not just keyword matching.\n\n#### Expected Behavior\n\n1.
